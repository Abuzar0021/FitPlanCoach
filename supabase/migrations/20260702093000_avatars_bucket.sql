-- Profile picture uploads were failing because the "avatars" bucket only
-- ever existed as a manual dashboard step (easy to miss, and lost on a full
-- database reset) — unlike "media", which is fully SQL-provisioned. Give
-- avatars the same treatment: each user can read any avatar (they're shown
-- publicly across the app) but only write/update/delete their own, enforced
-- by the "<user_id>/..." path prefix the upload code already uses.
